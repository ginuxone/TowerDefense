# TowerDefense
Game I'm developing on my free time.

The scope to reach is to create a simple an easy game for all those Tower defense lovers. 
Why I do this?
Because i though it would be fun to make my own tower defense game.
And since I'm willing to dev and improve it. This could increase my skills as developer

I'm using the following to dev this :

  * Phaser.io
  * TypeScript
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
